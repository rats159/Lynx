# Welcome to **Lynx**!
Lynx is a method-chaining based library for your HTML websites.

Currently, it's incomplete. Many HTML elements are missing, as well as the majority of HTML attributes.

Feel free to use it if you want! Just copy `Lynx.js` into your code, and leave the little credit bit if you're feeling nice.
